## About The Project

Intorducing Live.Ly, a fan engagement app focussed on sporting events that is guarenteed to keep viewership as high as can be. 
Upgrade from your traditional methods and keep viewership at all time highs with this fun trivia app

There is so much available to watch nowadays, so you can’t fault the customer for leaving to another program the moment things get less entertaining.
Never again will your  customers decide to stop watching mid game because of half-time, or a commercial break, as our app is sure to keep the user engaged throughout the event through trivia-based questions relating to the live sport.

Users will then have the opportunity to answer questions pulled from public APIs relating to the sport they’re watching during the commercial break or half-time.
